# BookFlow - Jupyter-book and MLFlow - A match made in heaven

This is something I've been wanting to create for a long time. Only this year I've really started looking into it, and quite recently my enthusiasm was sparked anew by the release of Jupyter Book. So here it is, and I dub thee "BookFlow"!

BookFlow is a combination of a certain workflow and some tools. The guide that you are reading now will use MLFlow and Jupyter Book. In the future I may extend it with alternative - in particular R Bookdown. 

```{margin}
**R Bookdown** has existed for quite a while now, and is very powerful. It can do all the essential things that I will do here with Jupyter Book as well. Also note that either tool can use either language, although not all Jupyter Book functionality is available for R yet. I'm using Jupyter Book because I feel the experience is just a little bit smoother, and because I was excited to do something with Jupyter Book. For Latex document, R Bookdown is currently more powerful.

Don't think that just because it includes the acronym "ML" in one of the tools, BookFlow is only useful for machine learning practitioners! In fact, it's useful for anyone that works with both code and data and sometimes have to communicate the results. Data scientists, academics, analysts and statisticians in any field.
